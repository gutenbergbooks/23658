<p>Two men carrying bombs were arrested last week on the outskirts of
Paris, and are suspected of a plot against the <span class="sc">French President</span>. They
alleged that the bombs were made for the <span class="sc">Tsar of Russia</span>, but the <span class="sc">Tsar</span>
denies that he gave the commission.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The town of Criccieth, it is reported, has decided to give up gas in
favour of electricity. This, of course, is not meant as a slight on its
most illustrious resident.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Posted at Ventnor, Isle of Wight, on July 14, 1904, a postcard has just
been delivered at the Grapes Hotel in Cowes. The recipient is said to
have expressed the opinion that it would have been quicker, almost, to
have telephoned the message.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Miss <span class="sc">Nina Boyle</span>, of the Women's Freedom League, has sent to the papers a
list of ladies on whom she considers the <span class="sc">King</span> ought to bestow honours.
Among the writers there is one notable omission, and Miss <span class="sc">Marie Corelli</span>
is said to be more of an anti-Suffragette than ever.</p>

<p>"NEW THEATRE FOR LONDON,<br />
<span class="sc">all seats in the house to be booked</span>."</p>

<p>So the great difficulty has been solved at last! So may theatres fail
because the seats are not taken.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A movement is on foot to induce Mr. <span class="sc">Charles Garvice</span> to change the name
of his play, <i>A Heritage of Hate</i>, as so many patrons of melodrama have
experienced difficulty in pronouncing the title as it stands at present.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>In a struggle between a British sailor and a German policeman at
Wilhelmshaven the other day honours seem to have been fairly even. The
policeman, who used his sword, lost his head, and the sailor a piece of
his nose.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Two men of good position were tried last week before the State Court of
Berlin for refusing to address a policeman as "Mr." That will surprise
no one who knows his Prussia. It is the sequel which takes our breath
away. The two men were acquitted!</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Volume 10 of the Census of 1911 shows that in the preceding ten years
clergymen of the Established Church declined from 25,235 to 24,859. "The
decrease is accounted for by the lack of young men taking orders." The
wonder is that such orders were not at once snapped up by alert Germans.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Miss <span class="sc">Laura Wentworth</span>, of Nebraska, known as "The Big Hat Girl," has, we
are told, sailed from New York in the <i>Imperator</i> with a hat which
measures 58 inches in diameter. These giant liners are justifying
themselves.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We are glad that the <span class="sc">Postmaster-General</span> has promised a Bill against
foreign sweeps. Only the other day we received a circular headed
"Schimneys Scheaply Schwept."</p>

<p>While we are ready to grant that it is not always easy to find the apt
quotation, we cannot help thinking that <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> would have
caused less offence if it had published the following paragraph without
any tag at all:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
     The Mayor and Mayoress of Kensington, Alderman and Mrs. W. H.
     Davison, held a reception at the Kensington Town trail last
     evening, their guests numbering between 400 and 500.</p>

<p>"Cheerful Company at all the Caf√©s. Soup to Cheese 1/-," announces an
advertisement in <i>The Manchester Guardian</i>. We have heard of lively
cheese before, but the chatty soup must be something of a novelty.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Strawberries are going out," reports <i>The Evening News</i>. We are in a
position to confirm this statement. We met one out the other evening.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>According to <i>La France Militaire</i> the French Navy is about to try the
experiment of enlisting black sailors. We should say that they will be
found to make the most admirable stokers, not showing the dirt like the
white men.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Describing a recent visit of a party of Congressmen and State officials
to one of the teetotal battleships of the American Navy, a contemporary
says, "The distinguished guests took water with what grace they could."
Evidently they thought it scarcely worth saying grace for.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The statement made last week in the course of a certain trial that "as a
man grows older he becomes riper" has had a curious sequel. Orders are
pouring in from the Cannibal Isles for consignments of centenarians.</p>

<h2>A WARM HALF-HOUR.</h2>

<p>Whatever the papers say, it was the hottest afternoon of the year. At
six-thirty I had just finished dressing after my third cold bath since
lunch, when Celia tapped on the door.</p>

<p>"I want you to do something for me," she said. "It's a shame to ask you
on a day like this."</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> rather a shame," I agreed, "but I can always refuse."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you mustn't. We haven't got any ice, and the Thompsons are
coming to dinner. Do you think you could go and buy three pennyworth?
Jane's busy, and I'm busy, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I'm busy," I said, opening and shutting a drawer with great
rapidity.</p>

<p>"Just three pennyworth," she pleaded. "Nice cool ice. Think of sliding
home on it."</p>

<p>Well, of course it had to be done. I took my hat and staggered out. On
an ordinary cool day it is about half-a-mile to the fishmonger; to-day
it was about two miles-and-a-quarter. I arrived exhausted, and with only
just strength enough to kneel down and press my forehead against the
large block of ice in the middle of the shop, round which the lobsters
nestled.</p>

<p>"Here, you mustn't do that," said the fishmonger, waving me away.</p>

<p>I got up, slightly refreshed.</p>

<p>"I want," I said, "some&mdash;&mdash;" and then a thought occurred to me.</p>

<p>After all, <i>did</i> fishmongers sell ice? Probably the large block in front
of me was just a trade sign like the coloured bottles at the chemist's.
Suppose I said to a Fellow of the Pharmaceutical Society, "I want some
of that green stuff in the window," he would only laugh. The tactful
thing to do would be to buy a pint or two of laudanum first, and <i>then</i>,
having established pleasant relations, ask him as a friend to lend me
his green bottle for a bit.</p>

<p>So I said to the fishmonger, "I want some&mdash;some nice lobsters."</p>

<p>"How many would you like?"</p>

<p>"One," I said.</p>

<p>We selected a nice one between us, and he wrapped a piece of <i>Daily
Mail</i> round it, leaving only the whiskers visible, and gave it to me.
The ice being now broken&mdash;I mean the ice being now&mdash;well, you see what I
mean&mdash;I was now in a position to ask for some of his ice.</p>

<p>"I wonder if you could let me have a little piece of your ice," I
ventured.</p>

<p>"How much ice do you want?" he said promptly.</p>

<p>"Sixpennyworth," I said, not knowing a bit how much it would be, but
feeling that Celia's threepennyworth sounded rather mean.</p>

<p>"Six of ice, Bill," he shouted to an inferior at the back, and Bill
tottered up with a block about the size of one of the lions in Trafalgar
Square. He wrapped a piece of <i>Daily News</i> round it and gave it to me.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" asked the fishmonger.</p>

<p>"That is all," I said faintly; and, with Algernon, the overwhiskered
crustacean, firmly clutched in the right hand and Stonehenge supported
on the palm of the left hand, I retired.</p>

<p>The flat seemed a very long way away, but having bought twice as much
ice as I wanted, and an entirely unnecessary lobster, I was not going to
waste still more money in taxis. Hot though it was, I would walk.</p>

<p>For some miles all went well. Then the ice began to drip through the
paper, and in a little while the underneath part of <i>The Daily News</i> had
disappeared altogether. Tucking the lobster under my arm I turned the
block over, so that it rested on another part of the paper. Soon that
had dissolved too. By the time I had got half-way our Radical
contemporary had been entirely eaten.</p>

<p>Fortunately <i>The Daily Mail</i> remained. But to get it I had to
disentangle Algernon first, and I had no hand available. There was only
one thing to do. I put the block of ice down on the pavement, unwrapped
the lobster, put the lobster temporarily in my pocket, spread its <i>Daily
Mail</i> out next to the ice, lifted the ice on to the paper, and&mdash;looked
up and saw Mrs. Thompson approaching.</p>

<p>She was the last person I wanted at that moment. In an hour and a half
she would be dining with us. Algernon would not be dining with us. If
Algernon and Mrs. Thompson were to meet now, would she not be expecting
him to turn up at every course? Think of the long-drawn-out
disappointment for her; not even lobster sauce!</p>

<p>There was no time to lose. I decided to abandon the ice. Leaving it on
the pavement I turned round and walked hastily back the way I had come.</p>

<p>By the time I had shaken off Mrs. Thompson I was almost at the
fishmonger's. That decided me. I would begin all over again, and would
do it properly this time.</p>

<p>"I want," I said boldly, "threepennyworth of ice."</p>

<p>"Three of ice, Bill," said the fishmonger, and Bill gave me quite a
respectable segment in <i>The Morning Post</i>.</p>

<p>"And I want a taxi," I said, and I summoned one.</p>

<p>We drove quickly home.</p>

<p>As we neared the flat I suddenly remembered Algernon. I drew him out of
my pocket, red and undraped.</p>

<p>This would never do. If the porter saw me entering my residence with a
nice lobster, the news would soon get about, and before I knew where I
was I should have a super-tax form sprung on me. I placed the block of
ice on the seat, took off its <i>Morning Post</i>, and wrapped up Algernon.
Then I sprang out, gave the man a shilling, and got into the lift.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Bless you," said Celia, "have you got it? How sweet of you!" And she
took my parcel from me. "Now we shall be able&mdash;&mdash;Why, what's this?"</p>

<p>I looked at it closely.</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;it's a lobster," I said, "Didn't you say lobster?"</p>

<p>"I said ice."</p>

<p>"Oh," I said, "oh, I didn't understand. I thought you said lobster."</p>

<p>"You can't put lobster in cider cup," said Celia severely.</p>

<p>Of course I quite see that. It was rather a silly mistake of mine.
However, it's pleasant to think that the taxi must have been nice and
cool for the next man.</p>

<h2>PAYMENT IN KIND.</h2>

<p>I argued that one and threepence was too much to pay for the delivery of
a telegram which had only cost sixpence itself; I also argued that one
and threepence was too little for a wealthy institution like the G.P.O.
to worry about, but the messenger wouldn't reduce the price. I had had
my telegram, said he, and I must pay for it. I offered to give him the
telegram back, but he guessed it was only from Carr and wasn't having
any. It was my money he wanted and that, unhappily, was some miles away
in a bank.</p>

<p>For reasons best known to myself, and not too clearly appreciated even
in that quarter, I am always full of petty cash at the beginning of the
month and out of it at the end. My wife never draws any at all, knowing
it is much safer where it is, and as for Albert, our only son, he takes
no interest in the stuff. When we, in moments of self-denial, slip a
coin into the slit of his money-box, he is merely bored, being as yet
unable to unlock the box and get the coin out again, owing to ignorance
of the whereabouts of the key. I explained all this to the telegraph
boy, but his heart didn't soften; so, still parleying with him in the
porch, I sent the maid to my wife to see what she could do to ease the
financial position.</p>

<p>The maid returned with a shilling, which was my wife's limit, and this I
tendered to the boy, explaining to him the theory of discount for net
cash. But he was one of those small and obstinate creatures who won't
learn, so I sent him round to the back premises to get some tea, while I
retired to the front to do some thinking. It was at this moment that
Albert chose, imprudently, to make an important announcement from the
top of the stairs with regard to a first tooth, which he had lost by
extraction the day before but had not yet been able to forget. His idea
was that he should come down and inspect it once more; but I paid no
heed to this. His mention of the matter suggested, when I came to think
of it, a solution of my difficulty with the telegraph boy.</p>

<p>Later, I asked my wife to step into my study and to shut the door behind
her. "This has become a serious matter," said I; "nay, it threatens to
be a grave scandal. You remember Albert's tooth?"</p>

<p>She did. These things are not easily forgotten. "I wish," I pursued, "to
interview Albert's nurse as to it," and I rang the bell sternly.</p>

<p>"She hasn't got it," said my wife; "we have," and she took from the
mantelpiece a small packet tied up with pink ribbon.</p>

<p>I explained that it wasn't the child's molar but the child's funds that
I was concerned with. "You will recollect that I compensated him for the
loss of it with a shilling. It makes it all the more poignant that it
was my last shilling. I put it into his money-box, the key of which is
accessible to miscreants. That shilling is gone!"</p>

<p>My wife smiled. "How did you find out?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I had reason to be looking in the box," I said airily, "and happened by
chance to notice that the shilling had been stolen."</p>

<p>"You mean," said she, "that you were proposing to steal it yourself?"</p>

<p>I disregarded the question. "I never did trust that nurse," said I. "But
to steal the treasured capital of a defenceless infant!"</p>

<p>"I am the thief," said my wife, "and you are the receiver. Whether or
not the telegraph-boy will be jointly charged with us is for the police
and Albert to decide between them."</p>

<p>At this moment the nurse entered and asked what we required of her. My
wife was confused, but not so I. I told nurse we required nothing of her
but much of Albert. Would she ask him to step downstairs?</p>

<p>We assembled in the porch, my wife, Albert, the nurse, and the telegraph
boy. I took the chair.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," said I, "I have a proposal to lay before the
meeting with a view to adjusting the acute crisis. Let me remind you of
the facts:&mdash;The gentleman on my right," and I indicated Albert, whose
attention wandered a little, "was recently possessed of a tooth, two
parents, and a godfather of the name of Carr. The tooth, as teeth will,
had to be removed; the parents, as parents may, advanced a shilling upon
it; and the godfather, as godfathers needn't, telegraphed to say he was
coming forthwith to the <i>locus in quo</i>. Things were so when Mr. (I
didn't catch your name, Sir," and I turned to the telegraph boy)
"threatened to liquidate us unless his debt was satisfied. Business is,
as he very properly remarked, business. "Now for my suggestion: Albert,"
and I turned to him again, "will have, the telegram, which, being from
<i>his</i> godfather, is rightly his. He will, however, take it subject to
encumbrances, of which, I understand, he has already discharged all but
threepence. Happily his parents are willing to withdraw their first
charge on his personal assets, and I have much satisfaction, Sir"&mdash;I
bowed to the telegraph boy&mdash;"in presenting you with the goods, which
were as recently as yesterday valued at no less than a shilling, and in
asking you to keep the balance as a mark of our unshaken affection and
esteem."</p>

<p>And I handed him Albert's tooth.</p>

<h2>BLANCHE'S LETTERS.</h2>

<h3><span class="sc">Some Outstanding Features.</span></h3>

<p class="author"> <i>Park Lane.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Dearest Daphne</span>,&mdash;The outstanding features of the season have certainly
been the Friendship F√™te, the Kamtchatkan Scriptural opera-ballet, "<i>No√©
s'embarque sur l'Arche</i>," and the Cloak!</p>

<p>The Friendship F√™te, to celebrate our not having had any scraps with any
foreign country for some little time, was simply immense. There were
descriptive tableaux and groups, and the one undertaken by your
Blanche&mdash;swords being turned into ploughshares and the figure of Peace
standing in the middle, with Bellona crouching at her feet&mdash;was said to
be an easy winner. I was Peace, of course, in chiffon draperies, with my
hair down. I hadn't the faintest notion what sort of thing a ploughshare
was, but I'd clever people to help me, and so it was all right. But oh,
my best one! the difficulty I had in getting a Bellona! They all wanted
to be Peace, and some of them were so absolutely horrid about it that I
couldn't help telling them they were only showing how <i>fit</i> they were to
be Bellona! (I will tell <i>you</i> in confidence that I believe one of them
was responsible for some of my swords and ploughshares falling down with
an immensely odious crash just as the opening ceremony was going on.)
Norty was given the group of all nations, called, "All Men are
Brothers," and he said on the whole it was rather a rotten job; there
was a lot of friction, and at one time he was afraid things might get
almost to <i>diplomatic</i> lengths; however, it all went smoothly at last.
Still he told me <i>√† l'oreille</i> that he was glad it was well over, as two
or three Friendship F√™tes would be enough to shake the peace of Europe
to its foundations!</p>

<p>But nothing matters much while one can go and see the wonderful,
<i>wonderful</i> Kamtchatkans in "<i>No√© s'embarque sur l'Arche</i>"&mdash;a feast of
beauty&mdash;a riot of colour&mdash;a mass of inner meanings. Who am I, dearest,
that I should try to word-paint it? Being an opera-ballet, there are two
Noahs, a singing one and a dancing one. While that glorious Golliookin,
the singing Noah, is giving the marvellous Flood Music in a gallery over
the stage, our dear wonderful Ternitenky, the dancing Noah, is going
into the Ark in a series of the most delicious <i>pas seuls</i>. Then his
dance of Astonishment and Alarm as he sees the waters rising&mdash;and
afterwards his dance of Joy and Thankfulness at finding himself quite
dry! The <i>Pas de Six</i> of Noah's Sons and their Wives! And the <i>ensemble</i>
dancing of the Animals! My dearest, you positively must and shall leave
your solitudes and come and see the Kamtchatkans in Scriptural
opera-ballet! Only second to <i>No√©</i> is <i>La Femme de Lot</i>, with dear
Sarkavina, in clouds of white, doing a sensational whirling dance as she
turns into the Pillar, while that amazing soprano, Scriemalona, sings
the mysterious Salt Music. Bishops quite <i>swarm</i> at these performances.
They say they consider it their <i>duty</i> to go, and that they never
<i>really</i> understood the true character of <span class="sc">Noah</span> till they saw
Ternitenky's beautiful flying leap into the Ark, or quite grasped the
personality of <span class="sc">Lot's</span> Wife before seeing Sarkavina's Pillar-of-Salt
dance.</p>

<p>On <i>No√©</i> and <i>Lot</i> nights it's correct to carry a little darling Old
Testament, bound in velvet or satin to match or contrast with one's
toilette, and generally with jewels on the cover; and the Old Testament
is quite often mentioned at dinner just now, people pretending they've
been reading it, and so on. <i>√Ä propos</i>, Mrs. Golding-Newman, one of the
latest climbers, excused herself for being late at dinner somewhere the
other night by saying, "I was reading Deuteronomy and didn't notice how
the time was going." The Bullyon-Boundermere woman was present and,
determined to trump her rival's trick, chipped in with, "Oh, <i>isn't</i>
Deuteronomy <i>charming</i>? But I think of <i>all</i> the books of the Old
Testament my favourite is In Memoriam!"</p>

<p>The Cloak, my Daphne, which is one of the most interesting arrivals in
town this summer, is, <i>√† mon avis</i>, something quite <i>more</i> than a
garment&mdash;it is a great big test of all that a woman most prides herself
on! You may see a thousand women with cloaks on, but how many will be
<i>really wearing</i> them! As one criticised the cloaks and their wearers in
the Enclosure at Aswood one couldn't help murmuring with a small sigh,
"Who is sufficient for these things!" People who have the cloak fastened
on <i>in just any way</i>, my dear, are simply begging the question; in its
true inwardness, in its loftiest development, the cloak should be a
separate creation, kept in its place only by the grace and knack of its
wearer. There should be <i>character</i> about it, a fascinating droop, a
sweat crookedness that can only happen when it is worn with the art
that&mdash;you know the rest.</p>

<p>Shall I confide to you my little secret, dearest? Would you know why it
is given to your Blanche to be easily best of the few women who do
really <i>wear</i> the cloak? When I'm ready, all but nay cloak, I run away
from Yvonne down the stairs; she follows, carrying the cloak, and when
she's beginning to overtake me she throws the cloak and I catch it on my
shoulders. Result&mdash;I'm the envy and despair of all my best beloved
enemies!</p>

<p>People have been trying to find new places to wear their watches. A
small watch on the toe of each shoe (plain for day wear, jewelled for
the evening) had quite a little vogue, though as watches they were no
good, for no one could see the time by them. Then little teeny watches
on the tips of glove-fingers were liked a little. But the latest
development is that Time is <i>d√©mod√©</i>, and anyone mentioning hours and
half-hours is stamped as an outside person.</p>

<p>Isn't this a <i>fragrant</i> idea about our not being to blame for anything
we do, because it's all owing to the <i>colours</i> we live with? Everybody's
<i>charmed</i> about it. Instead of going to <i>lawyers</i> when things run off
the rails a little, if one just called in a <i>colour-expert</i> all sorts of
horrors might be avoided, for he would prove that people are like that
owing to the colours of their curtains and upholsteries, and aren't to
blame themselves, poor, dears, the very least little bit! The
Thistledown <i>m√©nage</i>, for instance. For ages it's been tottery, because
Thistledown never understood Fluffy, and Fluffy, poor little thing,
seemed to understand everybody except Thistledown. We've all been so
sorry for her, for several times he's been on the point of dragging
things into public. And now it turns out that nothing is Fluffy's fault
and that, if she hadn't always had her own, own room done in pinky-bluey
shades, she might have been quite a serious domestic character! T. says,
if that's so, she'd better have her own, own room done in some other
colour, but Fluffy says, No, she likes pinky-bluey shades, only he must
remember, when he's inclined to be hard on her, that the pinky-blueys
are to blame and not herself.</p>

<p>Then there's old Lady Humguffin, easily the most miserly old dear who
ever wore a transformation (she even has a taxi-meter thing in her own
motors and anyone driving with her is expected to pay what it
registers!). Colour-experts say that if it weren't for the frightfully
dull dusty purple in which all her rooms are furnished she might part
quite freely!</p>

<p>So there it is, my dear! People say there's been no such important
discovery since Gallienus&mdash;that fearful old man, you know, who said
something moved when everyone else said it didn't. (I hardly know <i>how</i>
I know these things. Please, please don't think I'm becoming a <i>femme
savante</i>!).</p>

<p>Ever thine,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="sc">Blanche</span>.</p>

<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg 69]</span></p>

<h2>TOO MUCH CHAMPIONSHIP.</h2>

<p>Once life was an easy thing.</p>

<p>Yorkshire or Surrey or Kent were cricket champions. <span class="sc">Ranji</span> or W. G.
headed the batting averages; <span class="sc">Rhodes</span> or <span class="sc">Richardson</span> the bowling. The
office boy who knew these details plus the Boat Race winner and the
English Cup-holders could keep his end up in conversation. He even found
time to do a little work.</p>

<p>But now! That poor brain must know that McGinty of Fulham fetched ¬£1,000
when put up for auction, that the front line of Blackburn Rovers
represents an expense of ¬£11,321 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, and that Chelsea have
played before 71,935 spectators. He must know the champions of the
First, Second, Southern, Midland, and Scottish Leagues, and the teams
that gained promotion.</p>

<p>Then there is cricket&mdash;all worked out to "those damned dots," as Lord
<span class="sc">Randolph</span> said in an inspired moment. Think of the strain of remembering
that Middlesex stands at 78.66 and Surrey at 72.94. And the sporting
papers are publishing lists of catches made; and lists of catches missed
are sure to follow. Think of it&mdash;you may have to name the Champion
Butterfingers in 1915!</p>

<p>Come to tennis. You must know the names of the Australian Terror, the
New Zealand Cyclone, the American Whirlwind. You must at a glance be
able to pronounce on the nationality of Mavrogordato or Froitzheim. You
have the strain of proving that the victory of a New Zealander over a
German proves the vitality of the dear old country.</p>

<p>Or boxing. How can an ordinary mind retain the names of all the White
Hopes or Black Despairs. At any moment some Terrible Magyar may wrest
the bantam championship from us. You must learn to distinguish between
<span class="sc">Wells</span>, the reconstructor of the universe, and Knock-out <span class="sc">Wells</span>. You must
be acquainted with the doings and prospects of Dreadnought Brown and
Mulekick Jones. You must know the F. E. Smithian repartees of <span class="sc">Jack
Johnson</span>.</p>

<p>Let us talk of golf. No, on second thoughts, let us notably refrain from
talking about golf. Only if you don't know who defeated <span class="sc">Travers</span> (<i>plus</i>
lumbago) and who eclipsed America's Bright Boy, you must hide your head
in shame.</p>

<p>We come to rowing. Once one could stay, "Ah, Leander," and with an easy
shrug of the shoulders pass from the subject. But when international
issues are involved, and the win of a Canadian or American or German
crew may cause <i>The Daily Mail</i> to declare (for the hundredth time) that
England is played out, a man simply has to keep abreast of the results.</p>

<p>There are a score of other things. Name for me, if you can, the Great
American Four, the hydro-aeroplane champion, the M.P. champion
pigeon-flyer, and the motor-bike hill-climbing champion.</p>

<p>And the Olympic games are coming! Who are England's hopes in the
discus-throwing and the fancy diving? What Britisher must we rely on in
the javelin hop-skip-and-jump?</p>

<p>Your brain reels at the prospect. We must decide to ignore all future
championships. We must decline to be aggravated if a Japanese Badminton
champion appears. We must cease to be interested if Britain's Hope beats
the Horrible Peruvian at Tiddly-winks.</p>

<p>There are three admirable reasons for this.</p>

<p>The first is that we must play some games ourselves.</p>

<p>The second, that, unless a check be put to championships, the
Parliamentary news will be crowded out of the papers and we shall find
ourselves in an unnatural state of peace and goodwill.</p>

<p>The third, which one puts forward with diffidence, is that somebody,
somewhere, somehow, sometime must do a little work.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p>(<span class="sc">Extracted from the Diary of Toby, M.P.</span>)</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, July 6.</i>&mdash;All heads were bared when the <span class="sc">Prime
Minister</span> rose to move adjournment of <span class="sc">House</span> in sign of sorrow at the
passing way of a great Parliament man. To vast majority of present House
<span class="sc">Joseph Chamberlain</span> is a tradition. His personal presence, its commanding
force, is varied and invariable attraction are unknown. Since his final
re-election by faithful Birmingham, where, like the Shunamite woman, he
dwelt among his own people loving and loved, he only once entered the
House.</p>

<p>It was a tragic scene, perhaps happily witnessed by few. Appointed
business of sitting concluded and Members departed, a figure that once
commanded attention of a listening Senate slowly entered from behind the
<span class="sc">Speaker's</span> chair. It was the senior Member for Birmingham come to take
the oath. The action was indicative of his thoroughness and loyalty. No
longer were oaths, rolls of Parliament and seats on either Front Bench
matters of concern to him. His manifold task was done. His brilliant
course was run. But, until he took the oath and signed the roll, he was
not <i>de jure</i> a Member of the House of Commons, and his vote might not
be available by the Whips for a pair on a critical division.</p>

<p>Accordingly here he was, moving haltingly with the aid of a stick,
supported by the strong arm of the son whose maiden speech his old chief
<span class="sc">Gladstone</span> years ago welcomed as "dear and refreshing to a father's
heart." He took the oath and signed the roll&mdash;an historic page in a
unique volume. With dimmed eyes he glanced round the familiar scene of
hard fights and great triumphs, and went forth never to return.</p>

<p>To-day he lived again in speeches delivered by the <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span>, by
the <span class="sc">Leader of the Opposition</span>, and by the Cabinet colleague and leader to
whom he was loyal to the last. The practice of delivering set eulogies
to the memory of the departed great is the most difficult that falls to
the lot of a Leader on either side of House of Commons. In some hands it
has uncontrollable tendency to the artificiality and insipidity of
funeral baked meats. <span class="sc">Disraeli</span> was a failure on such occasions; <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>
at his best. <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>, usually supreme, did not to-day reach his
accustomed lofty level.</p>

<p>In fineness of tone and exquisite felicity of phrasing, <span class="sc">Asquith</span> excelled
himself. The first time the House of Commons caught a glimpse of
profound depths of a nature habitually masked by impassive manner and
curt speech was when he talked to it in broken voice about
<span class="sc">Campbell-Bannerman</span>, just dead. Speaking this afternoon about one with
whom, as he said, he "had exchanged many blows," he was even more
impressive, not less by reason of the eloquence of his speech than by
its simplicity and sincerity.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;In the House of Lords <i>le brave</i> <span class="sc">Willoughby de Broke</span>
was, if the phrase be Parliamentary, broken in the Division Lobby.
Insisting on fighting the Home Rule Amending Bill to the last, he found
himself supported by ten peers, a Liberal Ministry having for an
important measure the majority, unparalleled in modern times, of 263.</p>

<p>When figures were announced Lord <span class="sc">Crewe</span>, reminiscent of the farmer
smacking his lips over a liqueur glass of old brandy, remarked to
Viscount <span class="sc">Morley</span>, "I should like some more of that in a moog."</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Interesting episode preceded main business of sitting. Sort
of rehearsal of meeting of Parliament on College Green. Opened by
<span class="sc">Sheehan</span> rising from Bench partially filled by O'Brienites to move issue
of new writ for North Galway. Had it been an English borough nothing
particular would have happened. Writ would have been ordered as matter
of course, and there an end on't.</p>

<p>Things different on College Green. When <span class="sc">Sheehan</span> sat down, up gat Captain
<span class="sc">Donelan</span> from Redmondite camp, which when moved to Dublin will, by reason
of numerical majority, be analogous to Ministerialists at Westminister.
<span class="sc">Donelan</span> remarked that in his capacity as Nationalist Whip he intended to
move issue of writ next Monday. This fully explained why <span class="sc">O'Brien's</span> young
man moved it to-day. Otherwise cause of quarrel obscure. What they
fought each other for dense mind of Saxon could not make out.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:30%;"><a href="images/73-1.jpg">
<img width="100%" src="images/73-1.jpg" alt="Tim Buonaparte" /></a>
<h4>TIM BUONAPARTE.</h4></div>

<p>Ambiguity partly due to <span class="sc">Donelan</span>. Lacking the volubility common to his
countrymen he had prepared heads of his speech jotted down on piece of
notepaper. This so intricately folded that sequence of remarks
occasionally suffered. Situation further complicated by accidental
turning over of notes upside down. House grateful when presently <span class="sc">Tim
Healy</span> interposed. He being past-master of lucid statement, we should now
know all about circumstances which apparently, to the temporary
shouldering aside of Ulster, rocked Ireland to its centre.</p>

<p>Unfortunately <span class="sc">Tim</span> was embarrassed by attempt to assume a novel
oratorical attitude. Usually he addresses House with studied
carelessness of hands lightly clasped behind his back. Presumably in
consideration of supreme national importance of the question whether
<span class="sc">Sheehan</span> should move issue of writ to-day or <span class="sc">Donelan</span> on Monday, he
essayed a new attitude. It recalled <span class="sc">Napoleon</span> at Fontainebleau folding
his arms majestically as he bade farewell to remnant of the Old Guard.</p>

<p>Attempt, several times repeated, proved a failure. Somehow or other
<span class="sc">Tim's</span> arms would not adjust themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg 74]</span>
to novel circumstances, and fell back into the old <i>laissez-faire</i>
position. Speech repeatedly interrupted on points of order by
compatriots on back benches. What was clear was that some one had filed
a petition in bankruptcy. Identity of delinquent not so clear.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:40%;"><a href="images/73-2.jpg">

"Prospective first Speaker of a modern Irish Parliament."
<p class="center">(Mr. <span class="sc">Swift MacNeill</span>.)</p></div>

<p>However, as a foretaste of debate in Home Rule Parliament, proceedings
interesting and instructive. Disposed of slanderous suggestions of
disorder. Never, or hardly ever, was a more decorous debate. To it <span class="sc">Swift
MacNeill</span>, prospective first Speaker of a modern Irish Parliament, lent
the dignity and authority of his patronage. Pretty to see him, as debate
went forward, glancing aside at his wigged-and-gowned brother in the
Chair, as who should say, "What do you think of this, Sir?"</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;With assistance of Ministerial forces, O'Brienite
motion for issue of writ for Galway defeated by Redmondite amendment to
adjourn debate. <span class="sc">William O'Brien</span> took swift revenge. House dividing on
<span class="sc">Premier's</span> motion allotting time for remaining stages of Budget Bill, he
led his little flock into Opposition Lobby, assisting to reduce
Ministerial majority to figure of 23. In this labour of love he found
himself assisted by abstention of two groups of Ministerialists, one
objecting to procedure on Finance Bill, the other thirsting for blood of
the Ulster gun-runners.</p>

<p>If <span class="sc">Premier</span> still hesitates about Autumn Session this incident should
help him to make up his mind. The Government will be safer with its
Members on the moors or the golf links than daily running the gauntlet
at Westminster.</p>

<p><i>House of Lords, Thursday.</i>&mdash;When noble lords take their legislative
business seriously in hand they show the Commons a better way. Their
dealing with the Amending Bill has been a model of businesslike
procedure. Speeches uniformly brief because kept strictly to the point.
Amendments carefully considered in council and moved from Front
Opposition Bench were carried by large majorities.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Home Rule Amending Bill turned inside out in two
sittings. Own father wouldn't know it. <span class="sc">Sark</span> sums up situation by
paraphrase of historic saying. "They have," he remarks, "made a new Bill
and call it Peace."</p>

<h2>ELECTION INTELLIGENCE.</h2>

<h3><span class="sc">Great American Invasion.</span></h3>

<p>The prospects of the forthcoming campaign in the East Worcestershire
Division have been greatly brightened by the decision of the well-known
sportsman, Mr. Otis Q. Janaway, to stand as an Independent Candidate
with the express purpose of speeding-up the British Legislature. Mr.
Janaway, who graduated in sociology at the University of Pensacola, and
has recently been naturalised as a British subject, has brought with him
a team of baseball players, four white and four coloured prize-fighters,
and a chorus of variety artistes who will appear and sing at all his
meetings. He is a powerful speaker with a great fund of anecdote, and
his programme includes Compulsory Phonetic Spelling, the establishment
of Christian Science, Electrocution, and the introduction of College
Yells in Parliament. If her husband is elected, Mrs. Janaway has
announced her intention of embracing the Speaker at the earliest
opportunity.</p>

<hr />

<p>Professor Thaddeus Mulhooly, who was until recently President of the
University of Tuskahoma, has taken up his residence at Ballybunnion with
a view to qualifying as Parliamentary Candidate for North Kerry.
Professor Mulhooly, whose grandparents resided at Tralee, has made a
very favourable impression by the filial affection shown in his election
war-cry, which runs, "Tralee, Trala, Tara Tarara, Tzing Boum Oshkosh."
His platform is that of a Pan-Celtic Vegetarian, and he has secured the
influential support of Mr. <span class="sc">Upton Sinclair</span>, who is acting as his election
agent, and who publicly embraced him at a meeting at Dingle last week.</p>

<hr />

<p>General Amos Cadwalader Stunt, the well-known Colorado mining magnate,
who recently purchased the Isle of Rum, has announced his intention of
contesting the Elgin Burghs in the Liquid Paraffin interest. At a
political meeting at Lossiemouth last week he held the attention of a
crowded audience for upwards of an hour, during which his bodyguard
serenaded him with mouth-organs and banjos, the interruptions of
hecklers having been effectually discounted by a liberal distribution of
chewing gum. At the close of this great effort General Stunt was
publicly embraced by his wife's mother, Mrs. Titania Flagler.</p>

<hr />

<p>The by-election campaign at Hanley opened auspiciously on Thursday with
a demonstration in favour of Mr. Cyrus P. Slocum, the eminent Pittsburg
safety razor magnate, who has been selected by the Association of
American Manufacturers in England to represent their interests at
Westminster. Before Mr. Slocum rose the audience sang "My Country, 'tis
of Thee" continuously for forty-five minutes and waved the Stars and
Stripes for fully twenty minutes longer. Finally, the popular candidate
was carried shoulder-high from the platform to his motor and smothered
with kisses from his compatriots, the vast assemblage dispersing to the
jocund strains of "John Brown's Body."</p>

<hr />

<p>Great satisfaction is felt in American golfing circles at the
announcement that Mr. Olonzo Jaggers has decided to contest the
Tantallon Division of Haddingtonshire. Mr. Jaggers, who has recently
erected a tasteful ch√¢let on the Bass Rock, has just issued his election
address. The two main planks of his platform are the legalising of the
Schenectady putter for all golf meetings, and of megaphones and
mouth-organs in the House of Commons.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Julius Pitherby, Esq., to myself.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Henry Anderson, who is an applicant for my temporarily vacant
situation as working gardener, assistant hedger and ditcher and
superintending odd man (single-handed), has referred me to you as to his
character and qualifications, stating that he was in your employment&mdash;I
gather some nine years ago&mdash;for a time. You will therefore, I trust,
forgive me if I take the liberty of asking you to be good enough to
answer the following questions concerning him and his wife. He calls
himself twenty-five, married, with no family.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Was</i> he in your employment?</p>

<p>(2) When?</p>

<p>(3) Is he twenty-five?</p>

<p>(4) Is he married?</p>

<p>(5) Has he no family?</p>

<p>(6) Is he <i>strictly</i> sober? (These words are to be taken quite
literally.)</p>

<p>(7) His wife ditto?</p>

<p>(8) Is he decent and morally respectable, careful in his habits and
guarded in his language?</p>

<p>(9) His wife ditto?</p>

<p>(10) Is he honest and reliable?</p>

<p>(11) His wife ditto, and <i>not one to answer back</i>?</p>

<p>(12) Are they both used to the country, contented in their sphere,
interested in rural surroundings, fond of children, fond of animals,
fond of fruit?</p>

<p>(13) Is he strong and healthy, neither shortsighted nor deaf? (I have
suffered much from both.)</p>

<p>(14) His wife ditto, <i>and always tidy</i>?</p>

<p>(15) Does he stammer? (I have been greatly inconvenienced by this.)</p>

<p>(16) His wife ditto?</p>

<p>(17) Does he squint? (This has often been a trial to me.)</p>

<p>(18) His wife ditto?</p>

<p>(19) Is he active, industrious, enthusiastic and an early riser,
good-natured, equable and obliging?</p>

<p>(20) His wife ditto, and <i>no gossip</i>?</p>

<p>(21) Is he a heavy smoker?</p>

<p>(22) His wife ditto?</p>

<p>(23) Is he well up to the culture of vegetables, the upraising of
flowers and the education of fruit, both outside and under glass?</p>

<p>(24) Is he capable of feeding hens, driving a motor, overhauling a
pianola, carving or waiting at table if required?</p>

<p>(25) To what Church do they belong? What are their favourite
recreations? Do they sing in the choir? if so, is he tenor or baritone;
his wife ditto?</p>

<p>(26) Are they on good terms with each other, and <i>no domestic
bickering</i>?</p>

<p>(27) What wages did you pay him?</p>

<p>(28) Why (on earth) did you part with him?</p>

<p>An immediate answer will greatly oblige. I enclose an addressed
envelope.</p>

<h2>ONCE UPON A TIME.</h2>

<h3><span class="sc">The Power of the Press.</span></h3>

<p>Once upon a time there was a quiet respectable little
spell-of-hot-weather, with no idea of being a nuisance or doing more
than warm people up a bit, and make the summer really feel like summer,
and add attraction to seaside resorts. Directly it reached our shores
every one began to be happy; and they would have gone on being so but
for the sub-editors, who cannot leave well alone but must be for ever
finding adjectives for it and teasing it with attentions. Just then they
were particularly free to turn their attentions to the kindly visitor,
because there was no good murder at the moment, and no divorce case, and
no spicy society scandal, and therefore their pages were in need of
filling. And seeing the little spell-of-hot-weather they gave way to
their passion for labelling everything with crisp terseness&mdash;or terse
crispness (I forget which)&mdash;and called it a "heat wave," and straightway
began to give it half the paper, and with huge headings such as, "<span class="sc">The
Heat-Wave</span>," "<span class="sc">Heat-Wave Still Growing</span>," "<span class="sc">80 in the Shade</span>," "<span class="sc">How to
Support such Weather</span>," so that the nice little spell-of-hot-weather was
gradually goaded into the desire really to justify this excitement.</p>

<p>"Very well," it said, "I never meant to be more than 80 in the shade and
a pleasant interlude in the usual disappointing English June; but since
they're determined I'm a nuisance I'll be one. I'll go up to 84."</p>

<p>And it did. It reached 84; and the wise people who like warmth said,
"How splendid! If only it would go on like this for ever! Not
hotter&mdash;just like this.".</p>

<p>But the sub-editors were not satisfied. They had got hold of a good
thing and they meant to run it for all it was worth. So "<span class="sc">Hotter than
Ever</span>" they sprawled across their papers, there still being nothing of
real public interest to distract them, "<span class="sc">Hotter Tomorrow</span>," "<span class="sc">Heat-Wave
Growing</span>," "<span class="sc">Terrible Heat</span>."</p>

<p>And now the spell-of-hot-weather was stimulated to be really vicious. "I
call Heaven to witness," it said, "that my sole desire was to be genial
and beneficial. But what can one do when one is taunted and provoked,
abused and nick-named like this? Very well then, I'll go up to 90!"</p>

<p>And it did. The sub-editors were delighted. "<span class="sc">Appalling Heat</span>," they
wrote, "<span class="sc">Tropical England</span>," "<span class="sc">Gasping London</span>," "<span class="sc">Heat-Wave Breaks all
Records</span>," "<span class="sc">Hottest Day for Fifty Years</span>," "<span class="sc">No Signs of Relief</span>."</p>

<p>And even the people who like warmth began to grumble a
little&mdash;hypnotised by the Press. But the spell-of-hot-weather had had
enough. "I'll go somewhere else, where I'm really welcome and they don't
have contents bills," it said, and it crossed the Channel to Paris. It
looked back to the English shores, deserted now by the happy paddlers
and bathers and baskers of the days before. "I'm sorry to leave you," it
said, "but don't blame me."</p>

<p>Yet the public did.</p>

<h2>THE GUARDED GREEN.</h2>

<p>[<i>It has been suggested that spectators at popular golf competitions
should be installed in grand stands and other enclosures, and be
restrained from wandering about the links.</i>]</p>

<p>In playing his tee shot from in front of the Green Steward's marquee,
Mr. Tullbrown-Smith, who took the honour in the final round of the 1916
Amateur Championship, unfortunately pulled his ball, with the result
that, narrowly missing the Actors' Benevolent Fund stand, it entered the
grand ducal box. The Grand Duke Raphael graciously decided that Mr.
Tullbrown-Smith should be presented to His Imperial Highness before
playing out. Pardonable nervousness proved fatal to the shot, which,
being badly topped, fell into the Press pen, where it was photographed
by <i>The Daily Mirror's</i> special artist before it could be recovered by
its owner.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It is interesting to record that along the straight mile boarded by the
shilling enclosure Mr. Tanquery McBrail, who had been playing with
marvellously decorative effect, had his ball blown into the bunker at
the tenth by the laughter of the less well-informed onlookers, while a
regrettable incident was the contribution of several empty ginger-beer
bottles to the natural difficulties of the hazard.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Some dissatisfaction was expressed among the occupants of the cinema
operators' cage. From the position allotted to them by the publicity
committee it was impossible to film the most interesting moments in the
Championship round, such as Mr. Tullbrown-Smith's acceptance of a peeled
banana from his caddie on emerging from the particularly scenic bunker
known as "Hell." Also a fine "picture" was missed at the 13th tee, where
Mr. Tanquery McBrail was surrounded by a militant suffragist, who had
invaded the course in spite of the rabbit-wire and double
<i>chevaux-de-frise</i>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Owing to the fact that the fashionable audience assembled in the
Guards', Cavalry and Bath Club stands insisted upon encoring both
players' wonderful putts at the 16th green, and the consequent delay of
nearly ten minutes, there were some rather ugly manifestations of
impatience in the cheaper seats. In spite of the fact that the Pale Pink
Pierrots had been specially engaged to fill the interval before the
finalists passed, they were so loudly booed upon their arrival that Mr.
Tanquery McBrail put his mashie approach into the Parliamentary
compound, amidst the jeers and hoots of the more unruly, who seemed to
forget that the royal and ancient game is not a music-hall
entertainment.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The fact that the links marshal had placed all the professional players
present in one row of fauteuils, opposite the long carry to the 18th
green, hardly seemed to further the interests of perfect golf. The
warmest acknowledgments are therefore due to a number of ex-open
champions, who kindly turned their backs on what proved one of the most
distressing episodes in the day's play.</p>

<hr />

<h2>A MARK OF DISTINCTION.</h2>

<p>When I passed our butcher's on my way to the station yesterday morning,
I noticed outside his shop a placard prominently displayed, which
read:&mdash;"Williamson's Spring Lamb. So different from the ordinary
butchers."</p>

<p>There was no apostrophe before the "s" in "butchers," so the reference
was clearly to Williamson and not Williamson's Spring Lamb.</p>

<p>"Is Williamson really different from his rivals?" I said to myself,
crossing to the other side of the road to take a general survey of the
shop front. No, the same sort of joints seemed to be hanging up as those
in other butchers' windows; the same sort of legends attached to those
which passers-by were invited to note particularly.</p>

<p>I crossed the road again. Yes, as I feared. There were several ordinary
flies and at least one bluebottle exercising themselves on the meat. The
choice cutlets were not isolated or decorated with garlands, or made a
fuss of in any way. They just fraternised on terms of equality with the
rest. The usual "young lady" in a smart blouse, with her bare pink neck
served up in a ham-frill, sat behind the usual window, probably trying
to work out the usual sums in butcher's arithmetic.</p>

<p>The top half of Mr. Williamson was visible behind his chopping-table. He
saw me and touched his hat&mdash;a bowler; nothing very extraordinary about
the bowler. The brim was certainly a great deal flatter than I like
personally, but quite in keeping with the general tastes of those who
purvey meat.</p>

<p>I thought it better to postpone further investigations, and reflected
that Honor might be able to enlighten me when I returned home that
evening.</p>

<p>"No," she said, when I asked her about it, "I haven't noticed anything
exceptionally superior about him."</p>

<p>"Bills any different?"</p>

<p>"No," she said, "they take as long to pay; about as exorbitant as most
of the others."</p>

<p>"Have you observed anything peculiar about his manners, then?" I said;
"does he ever throw chops at you, for instance, when you pass the shop?"</p>

<p>"No such luck," said Honor; "I'm a good catch."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they give you tea," I said, "when you make an afternoon call on
the sirloins?"</p>

<p>"Indeed they don't," said Honor, "not even when I go to pay something
off the book."</p>

<p>"Then perhaps you have cosy little auction bridge parties in the room
behind the cashier's window? No? Butchers are behind the times."</p>

<p>"There ought," said Honor, "to be a good joke to be made out of that&mdash;a
newspaper joke; but I can't quite see how to make it just yet."</p>

<p>"That's something to the good," I said. "However, to our muttons."</p>

<p>"Rotten," said Honor.</p>

<p>"What of his entourage?" I said, ignoring her comment; "his steak-bearer
and the like?"</p>

<p>"Nothing unusual; just <i>√©pris</i> with Emily."</p>

<p>"Then where, oh where," I said, "is this difference that Williamson
brags about?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Honor said helplessly.</p>

<p>"I shall find out," I said, "even if I have to do the housekeeping
myself for a bit."</p>

<p>"You can take it on," she said, "when you like."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Aha!" I said triumphantly, as I burst into the room this evening. "I've
solved the Williamson problem. He was standing at his door as I passed
just now, in all the regalia of his dread office."</p>

<p>"And you went up to him and said, 'Well, what about it?' and pointed to
the notice, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Not at all," I said; "I merely looked at him and the scales fell from
my eyes. He butches in spats."</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ellen Melicent Cobden</span> can certainly not be accused of writing too
hurriedly. I don't know how many years it is since, as "<span class="sc">Miles Amber</span>,"
she captured my admiration with that wonderful first novel, <i>Wistons</i>;
and now here is her second, <i>Sylvia Saxon</i> (<span class="sc">Unwin</span>), only just appearing.
I may say at once that it entirely confirms my impression that she is a
writer of very real and original gifts. <i>Sylvia Saxon</i> is not a pleasant
book. It is hard, more than a little bitter, and deliberately
unsympathetic in treatment. But it is grimly real. <i>Sylvia</i> herself is a
character that lives, and her mother, Rachel, almost eclipses her in
this same quality of tragic vitality. The whole tale is a tragedy of
empty and meaningless lives passed in an atmosphere of too much money
and too little significance. The "society" of a Northern manufacturing
plutocracy, the display and rivalry, the marriages between the enriched
families, the absence of any standard except wealth&mdash;all these things
are set down with the minute realism that must come, I am sure, of
intimate personal knowledge. <i>Sylvia</i> is the offspring of one such
family, and mated to the decadent heir of another. Her tragedy is that
too late she meets a man whom she supposes capable of giving her the
fuller, more complete life for which she has always ignorantly yearned.
Then there is <i>Anne</i>, the penniless girl, hired as a child to be a
playfellow for <i>Sylvia</i>, who herself loves the same man, and dies when
his dawning affection is ruthlessly swept away from her by the dominant
personality of <i>Sylvia</i>. A tale, one might call it, of unhappy women;
not made the less grim by the fact that the man for whom they fought is
shown as wholly unworthy of such emotion. A powerful, disturbing and
highly original story.</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Saki</span>" has been now for a number of years a great delight to me, and his
last work, <i>Beasts and Super-Beasts</i> (<span class="sc">Lane</span>), is as good as any of its
predecessors. Clothed in the elegant garments of <i>Clovis</i> or <i>Reginald</i>,
Mr. <span class="sc">Munro</span> makes plain to us how lovely this world might be were we only
a little bolder about our practical jokes. In the art of introducing
bears into the boudoir of a countess or pigs into the study of a
diplomat, and then clinching the matter with the wittiest of epigrams,
<i>Clovis</i> is supreme. He knows, too, an immense amount about the
vengeance that children may take upon their relations, and ladies upon
their lady friends. I like him especially when he man&oelig;uvres some
stupid but kind-hearted woman into a situation of whose peril she
herself is only cloudily aware, while the reader knows all about it.
That is the fun of the whole thing. The reader is for ever assisting
<i>Clovis</i> and <i>Reginald</i>; in the course of their daring adventures he
connives from behind curtains, through key-holes, from ambushes in
trees, and always, whilst the poor creature is being harried by wild
boars or terrified by menacing kittens, <i>Clovis</i> may be observed, with
finger on lip, begging of the intelligent reader that he will not give
things away. Of the present collection of stories I like best "A Touch
of Realism,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg 80]</span>
"The Byzantine Omelette," "The Boar-Pig," and "The Dreamer;" but all are
good, and I can only hope that it will not be too long before <i>Clovis</i>
once again invites us to further delightful conspiracies.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><i>Ars est celara artem</i>, and not to define and emphasise it in a foreword
to the reader. The motive of <i>The Last Shot</i> (<span class="sc">Chapman and Hall</span>) appears
in due course in the narrative; I would have preferred to discover it
gradually for myself rather than have the essence of it extracted and
poured into me in advance. The preface has not the excuse of a mere
advertisement; to open this book at any point is to read the whole, and
every page is the strongest possible incentive to the reading of the
others. If (as is not admitted) any personal explanation was necessary,
it should have been put at the end and in small type so that those who,
like myself, detest explanations might have avoided this one. I am the
more severe about this, because there can be no two opinions as to Mr.
<span class="sc">Frederick Palmer's</span> success in achieving his purpose, which, obviously,
was to conceive modern warfare as between two First-class Powers,
fighting in the midst of civilisation, and to reduce it to terms of
exact realism, showing the latest devices of destruction at work, but
carefully excluding those improbable and impossible agencies which the
more exuberant but less informed novelist loves to imagine and put in
play. Mr. <span class="sc">Palmer's</span> conception, though based upon some experience, is for
the most part speculative, of course, but I am confident that he gives
us an excellent idea of how the military machine would work in practice,
how its human constituent parts would feel inwardly, and what physical
and moral effects a battle would have upon those civilians who inhabited
and owned the battlefield. Whether or no the future will prove the truth
of the author's somewhat Utopian conclusions, he certainly founds them
upon a most exciting and convincing story, in which the "love interest"
is as powerful as could be desired.</p>

<p>Would you like to pay a round of visits to some delightful Shropshire
houses, as the friend and guest of a charming woman, who knows all about
what is most interesting in all of them, and has a pleasantly chatty
manner of telling it? Of course you would; so would anyone. That is why
I predict another success for Lady <span class="sc">Catherine Milnes Gaskell's</span> latest
house-book, <i>Friends Round the Wrekin</i> (<span class="sc">Smith, Elder</span>). Perhaps you have
pleasant memories of her former volumes in the same kind; if so, I need
say no more by way of introduction; but, if not, I must tell you that
her new book is very fairly described, in the words of the publisher, as
"a further collection of history and legend, garden lore and character
study." What the publishers modestly refrain from mentioning is the real
charm with which it has been written, a quality that makes all the
difference. There are also photographs of a number of wholly fascinating
houses (the kind that make me wistful when I see them in the
auctioneers' windows), and the author has some personal anecdote or
quaint scrap of legend to tell you about each. I am quite willing to
admit that the rambling book has increased lately to an extent
imperfectly justified by its average quality. Too many of them confuse
rambling with drivelling. But for the reflections of a cultivated woman,
one who has steeped herself in the lore of a country she evidently
loves, and can transcribe it with such tender and persuasive charm,
there should always be room. I may add&mdash;and your own tastes must decide
whether this is a flaw or a fresh merit&mdash;that Lady <span class="sc">Catherine's</span>
sympathies, political and social, are undisguisedly with the past, and
that the "Education of the People" comes in, upon almost every other
page, for as shrewd raps as her gentle nature will allow her to
administer.</p>

<p>I wish I were Mr. <span class="sc">Justus Miles Forman</span>. Because then, if I ever chanced
to wake up suddenly and find that I had been drugged in my sleep, and
the six immense rubies, brought here from the East by a far-off ancestor
and set in a black agate shield above my bed, to represent the "six
<i>gouttes</i> (or drops) <i>gules</i> on a field <i>sable</i>" of my immemorial
coat-of-arms, had been rudely reaved from me in the night by my cousin,
who had sent one each to his six sons, I should have no fear. I should
feel perfectly convinced that in a short time, by my own personal
exertions, but without exercising the least particle of intelligence, I
should recover those six rubies (representing six <i>gouttes</i> or drops
<i>gules</i>) and replace them in the black agate shield (representing a
field <i>sable</i>); and naturally enough, like the autobiographical hero of
<i>The Six Rubies</i> (representing&mdash;&mdash;I beg your pardon, I mean, published
by <span class="sc">Ward, Lock</span>), I should not dream of calling in the aid of the police.
Another jolly thing that would inspirit me would be the fact that each
of my adventures in search of the missing jewels would conform to a
separate and well-known type of magazine story: there would be one fire,
one notorious cracksman, one haunted castle, one cabinet with a secret
drawer, and so on. There would be plenty of excitement, plenty of
hairbreadth escapes. But I think that, when collating my experiences and
putting them into six-shilling form, I should delete some of the
tautologous references to the past which are one of the stern
necessities of serial publication. Otherwise my readers might begin to
feel slightly fatigued by my six ancestral <i>gouttes</i>. They might even
begin to feel that they did not much care if I had hereditary sciatica.</p>
